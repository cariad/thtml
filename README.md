`thtml` (**t**o **HTML**) is a CLI tool and Python package for converting text to HTML.

For example, to pipe a command through `thtml`:

```bash
ls -al --color | thtml
```

```html
<!doctype html><html>...</html>
```

Include `--open` to send the HTML directly to your default browser:

```bash
ls -al --color | thtml --open
```

## Installation

`thtml` requires Python 3.8 or later.

```bash
pip install thtml
```

## CLI usage

Pipe your command's output to `thtml`:

```bash
COMMAND | thtml
```

If your command needs to run in a pseudo-terminal to emit formatting escape codes:

```bash
thtml COMMAND
```

By default, `thtml` will write the HTML to stdout. To send the HTML to your default browser:

```bash
COMMAND | thtml --open
```

By default, `thtml` will generate an entire HTML document. To return only a fragment:

```bash
COMMAND | thtml --scope fragment
```

with open("hello.html", "w") as writer:
    write_html("\033[1mHello, world!\033[22m", writer)
```
