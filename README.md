`thtml` (**t**o **HTML**) is a CLI tool and Python package for converting text to HTML.

For example, to pipe a command through `thtml`:

```bash
ls -al --color | thtml
```

```html
<!doctype html><html>...</html>
```

Include `--open` to send the HTML directly to your default browser:

```bash
ls -al --color | thtml --open
```
